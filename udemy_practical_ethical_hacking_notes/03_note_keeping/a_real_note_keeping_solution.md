# note keeping

## what you want

* do you want version control?
* are you comfortable having to render a page to view the final view?
* do you want your documents to be extensible?

## use VScode and write markdown

* If you want to use Word, use http://www.writage.com/
* https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support
* Create a workspace, then new folder, and new files (all with *.md extension).
* There's also a remote-ssh terminal built in to the editor, and you can actually open a file tree remotely via an installed service with a small footprint.
  * this is not be ideal for a target.
  * when I have an engagement. I spin up a digitalocean VM, install kali and use that single OS instance to attack that client.  This is when I use the remote-ssh extension.

## Hey, why not?

* I'm feeling fancy, and would love to use jupyter notebooks.
* It's quite easy, and .net is now supported with `.net interactive notebook`.
* I've never used this, but I'm strongly considering this as a high touch method with a manual decision tree for pentesting enumeration actions.
    * [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/gb4k83/htb_bashed_and_my_learnings_oscp_journey/) inspired me to document a list of actions to take before I take the OSCP.  Maybe this is something you just learn to do while you're studying, particularly in a formal setting, but the idea that essentially everthing can be done with a fair success rate if performed methodically is appealing.  It's a The Answer for speed, and general accuracy.
    * I do believe, but will get absolute confirmation, that you can use your own automations on the OSCP.  IF you wrote metasploit, then you should use it.
    * maybe this can fit in somewhere: https://mybinder.org/
