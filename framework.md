My background:

I've been a functional IT dude since 2005, having a computer hobby since the late '90s.
I have a CISSP and have good technical know-how, but have been both an infarstructure and security generalist (which includes L1/L2 incident response activities, security engineering, vulnerability assessments, pentest remediations, etc).
I now have a baby, so I'm trying to be practical as I can't realistically site and study for "127 hours" in 30 days.


1. I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5sL0KQ0Usk

* framework for studying, what you need to know, etc.
* do write ups for each box using the OffSec report template to get used to it.
* use vulnhub, hackthebox.
* watch ippsec videos.
 
2. I then watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4twsh9e4-A

* this isn't worth watching necessarily.
* install OBS: screen capture yourself attacking, and then review.  If you have a machine with an NVIDIA card, you must go through the process detailed here: https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/laptop-black-screen-when-capturing-read-here-first.5965/

3. I then figured out that it is definitely worth just watching other people compromising boxes and decided I would watch some practical compromises and watch one a day:

* don't stop and watch all of these now... I'm going to build a long list of videos.  Plan to watch one a day.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Db1sF3Wo6w <-- yea, why not?
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82S8wFSypB4 <-- very basic
* ???
* profit

5. I've been seeking a course, so... this is one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE, which is essentially a quick take on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlK174d_uu8&list=PLLKT__MCUeiwBa7d7F_vN1GUwz_2TmVQj (referring to this: https://www.thecybermentor.com/zero-to-hero-pentesting).  Or the updated version on udemy, which I have access to from my company, which is nice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryzYAP92YOk

# notes

* create a script or playbook for each type of attack.  If http is located, determine the site type (liek wordpress, etc), and then attack given a certain strategy (password spraying into forms, etc).
